## Tidy triangle meshes for spatial data

Work in progress, everything very fragile at the moment. Particular todos: 

- systematize the structure vs. relation indexes, right now it's just pure luck
- sort out multi-objects, and creating multi-object rgl scenes for SpDFs
- default plotting aesthetics, user control
